# Data_Visualization_Terrorism

The objectives of these visualizations are to demonstrate the uprising of violence in the world, between the years 2000 and 2017. We want to capture the areas of the world most affected by this negative trend. Also, we can identify which terrorist/attack group has had more effect and when in time they started their activities.

### Visualization 

The variables that are the most interesting are the number of attacks and casualties based on the different regions and the attributes related to them, such as the terrorist group that did the attack or whether the attack was successful or not throughout time or the target type. For data exploration purpose, we have developed four other graphs that allow audience to gain an overall view of the global terrorism trend. This helps the audience to build up intuition about the issue, preparing user for more in depth interraction with the final visualization.
